Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project Overview
 Project Description:
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its structure, detect patterns, uncover relationships, and identify anomalies or missing values. EDA is a crucial first step in any data science or machine learning pipeline, helping to guide feature selection, model choice, and preprocessing.
 
 Objective:
To analyze a given dataset using visual and statistical methods, summarize its main characteristics, and derive insights that can guide further modeling or decision-making.

Dataset Used:
Netflixorginals.csv(Kaggle Dataset)

Key EDA Steps Performed:
- Data loading and basic info check (shape, types, null values)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Univariate analysis (histograms, boxplots)
- Bivariate analysis (scatter plots, correlation matrix, heatmaps)
- Grouping and aggregation
- Feature distributions and value counts
-Feature Engineering

Visualization Tools Used:
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas built-in plotting

 Outcomes of EDA:
- Identified key patterns and trends
- Detected missing and anomalous data
- Visualized correlations between variables
- Selected important features for machine learning models
- Suggested preprocessing steps such as normalization or encoding

Conclusion:
EDA provided a strong foundation for understanding the dataset and making data-driven decisions in the subsequent stages of modeling. Proper EDA helped ensure model accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.
